# Veltrix Product Directive

**Status: ACTIVE – ENFORCED**

All Veltrix features, UI, copy, and architecture must comply with this directive.

---

## 1. Core Mandate
Veltrix must outperform task, CRM, and automation tools by acting as an Operating System. Our existence is justified only if we:
- remove decisions
- reduce manual work
- increase execution quality
- increase income
- reduce stress

If a feature fails to advance at least one of these outcomes, it must not be built.

## 2. Table Stakes We Adopt
Veltrix must support, at minimum:
- task creation and assignment
- automations
- CRM pipelines
- dashboards
- integrations
- multi-user access

These are baseline requirements, not differentiators.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Rejections
Veltrix must never:
- require manual board setup
- rely on user motivation
- display data without guidance
- separate life from work
- overload users with options
- punish users for being human

Reject any design that resembles infinite boards, endless tabs, default complex filters, or setup-heavy workflows.

## 4. Execution Model (Mandatory)
### 4.1 Outcome-First System
- Users define outcomes, not individual tasks.
- Tasks auto-generate from those outcomes.
- Every task must map to revenue, growth, wellness, or leverage. If it lacks measurable impact, remove it.

### 4.2 Autopilot by Default
- Systems must run without user input.
- Tasks auto-create, automations self-trigger, priorities auto-adjust.
- Manual control exists but is never required.

### 4.3 Direction Over Data
- Dashboards must answer “What should I do next?”
- Metrics without recommendations are forbidden.
- Every insight must link to an action.

## 5. Human-Aware Productivity
Veltrix must adapt to the user. Account for energy levels, stress, burnout risk, and consistency patterns. Task load, timing, and expectations must adjust dynamically.

## 6. Performance → Reward Visibility
Veltrix must expose how effort drives results, how results drive money, and how improvement increases earning potential.
- Employees see paths to earn more.
- Founders see where money leaks.
- Creators see what scales.

## 7. System Unification Rule
Treat tasks, habits, finances, CRM, inventory, content, and investments as one connected system. No silos. Every component influences every other component.

## 8. UI & Technical Constraints
- Keep memory usage low; lazy-load heavy modules.
- Avoid heavy state libraries unless unavoidable.
- UI must feel calm and fast; no floating or non-functional controls.
- Simplify anything that can break.

## 9. Decision Rule (Final Gate)
Before shipping, confirm the feature:
1. Reduces thinking
2. Reduces manual work
3. Increases control
4. Increases income or execution quality

If the answer is “no” to all, the feature is rejected.

## Final Statement
Veltrix does not compete with tools; it replaces the need to manage them. If the system still requires discipline, memory, or constant attention, it has failed. Build accordingly.
