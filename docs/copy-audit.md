# Veltrix Dashboard Copy Audit

_Last updated: 2026-02-16_

## Directive
- This audit inherits the rules defined in [Veltrix Product Directive](veltrix-product-directive.md).
- Tone: pain → intervention → result, high urgency, zero fluff.
- Actions: headline plus CTA must describe the next move.
- Empty/Loading states: tell the operator what to do next, not why nothing exists.

## Remaining Modules To Sweep
- Any net-new analytics widgets or dashboards shipped after this sweep
- Additional studios (podcast, SMS, etc.) as they come online
- Any modal/empty states introduced after this audit

## Next Steps
1. Continue spot-auditing new UI as features ship; use this doc as source of truth.
2. The moment a new analytics widget or studio drops, log it here and run the tone sweep before it launches.
3. Recheck every modal and empty/loading state added after this audit—rewrite and record them before shipping.
4. Keep copy changes small and direct—if it feels polite, tighten it.
